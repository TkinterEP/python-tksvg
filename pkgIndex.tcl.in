# On Tk 8.7 and higher, do a no-op load, as svg support is buildin.
# As Tk may be loaded as a package, do the test on package require.
# Note, that multiple Tk packages with different versions may be available.

# The load command takes a symbol prefix (with title case) and not the package
# name. So, do not use the macro PACKAGE_NAME in the load command.
